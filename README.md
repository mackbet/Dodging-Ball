# Dodging-Ball

This is my first hyper casual game, kind of like Subway Surfers but simpler. There are obstacles in front of the player that he needs to bypass. For each obstacle passed, the player receives 1 point. Every 50 points, the difficulty of the levels changes.

# Difficult Levels

There are 4 types of difficult levels.

Level with colorful blocks. The player can pass through blocks with the same color as the ball.

The other 2 difficult types of levels: I was too lazy to get to them and write them down, but they are also cool.

P.S. Defects in gifs are due to their resolution being reduced.
